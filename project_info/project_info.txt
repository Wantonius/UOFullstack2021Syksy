Possible applications:
	- Own idea
	
	1. Copygram
		Make a simple instagram copy. Users need to log in to add new pictures and comment on other pictures.
		Pictures are displayed newest first. Only the user who has added the picture can remove it or its comments.
		All logged users can comment all pictures. All pictures added are public. No private pictures.
		
		Bonus: Add multiple different search filters for pictures. Add tags to pictures
	
	2. ToDo app
		Simple ToDo app. ToDos have description and state. States are atleast "pending" and "done". Optionally
		todos can have a deadline thus adding a state "late". Done todos are not removed but instead are moved
		to a different page to be displayed. They can be removed from there. All users have their own todos.
		
		This is mostly a frontend project. Make your todos look like post-its or such.
		
	3. Top Three lists
		An application for creating and liking top three song lists. Each list contains three songs. Song has the
		name of the song, description and url link to youtube or such. For example "My top three christmas songs".
		Lists have a name, description and tags. Tags can be used to search for lists. Lists are always displayed
		in the order of most likes. Only the user who created the list can remove or edit the list. Users can add new songs
		or use songs added by others to create new lists.
